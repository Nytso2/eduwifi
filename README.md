## Manually Connecting to Eduroam

After saving credentials, you must manually connect using `iwctl`:

## iwctl

Inside `iwctl`, run:
```bash

station wlan0 scan
```

station wlan0 get-networks
```
```bash
station wlan0 connect eduroam
```
Then enter your **full school email** and **password** when prompted.

## Uninstallation

To remove the installed binary:
```bash
make clean
```
## Troubleshooting

If you experience **permission issues**, ensure:

- You are running Eduwifi with `sudo`.  
- `iwd` is installed and running:
```bash
  sudo systemctl start iwd
```
- To enable `iwd` to start on boot, run:
```bash
  sudo systemctl enable iwd
```
